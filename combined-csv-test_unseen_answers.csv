Explain why Jorge knew a chemical reaction occurred.,Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.,MX_10-a1,Because it was bubbly.,MX.10.389.1,incorrect

unseen-answers,MX_18,MX,"A solution of water and material A is clear. A solution of water and material B is also clear. When the 2 solutions are mixed, a white solid settles to the bottom, leaving a clear liquid. What does the white solid indicate?",A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.],MX_18-a1,That indicates that there is a precipitate on the sides.,MX.18.176.1,incorrect

unseen-answers,MX_36a,MX,"Grace set up a science experiment. Here's what she wrote in her notebook. First I put eggshells into a cup and covered them with vinegar. After a while, small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshells. The next day there were more bubbles. In a couple of days, the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear. I think I made a solution and a reaction. Explain why Grace thinks she made a solution.",A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.,MX_36a-a1,She make a solution because she put eggshells into the cup and covered.,MX.36a.126.1,incorrect
